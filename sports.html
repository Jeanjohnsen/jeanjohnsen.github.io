    <h1>🏅  Athletics career 🏃‍♂️</h1>
    
    <p>
        Before I became a software engineer, I was deeply immersed in the world of competitive sports. As a former elite athlete, I dedicated years to rigorous training and competing at the highest levels. 💪
    </p>
  </br>
    <p>
        My experience in sports has instilled in me discipline, focus, and resilience—qualities that now drive my work in technology. The same passion that pushed me to excel on the field now fuels my dedication to delivering top-notch software solutions. 🚀
    </p>

    <p>
      Transitioning from the adrenaline-filled world of sports to the innovative realm of tech was a significant change, but the competitive spirit and commitment to excellence remain the same. The lessons learned on the field continue to guide my approach to problem-solving and innovation. 🌟
