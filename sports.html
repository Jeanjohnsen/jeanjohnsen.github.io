    <h1>Jean Johnsen - Former Elite Athlete</h1>
    
    <p>
        Before becoming a software engineer, I was deeply involved in competitive sports. As a former elite athlete, I dedicated years to rigorous training and competing at the highest levels.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        My experience in sports has shaped my discipline, focus, and resilienceâ€”qualities that I now bring to my work in technology. The same drive that pushed me to excel in sports fuels my passion for delivering high-quality software solutions.

    <p>
        Transitioning from the world of sports to tech was a significant change, but the competitive spirit and commitment to excellence remain the same. I believe that the lessons learned on the field continue to influence my approach to problem-solving and innovation.
